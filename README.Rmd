The goal of the rcme package is to support the sensitivity analysis of crime data to different types of measurement error. It is result of the [Recounting Crime Project](https://recountingcrime.com/). You can see the publications informing this work [here](https://recountingcrime.com/scientific-articles/).

## Installation

You can install the development version of rcme from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("RecountingCrime/rcme")
```

## Example


This is a basic example which shows how to get a corrected regression estimate when we assume measurement error on the independent variable with a recording rate (`R`) of 0.3, and an association between the focal variable and the recording rate (`D`) of 0.9 odds ratios.  
```{r example}
rcme_ind(
  formula = "disorder ~ log_violent_crime + white_british + unemployment + median_age",
  data = crime_disorder,
  focal_variable = "log_violent_crime",
  R = 0.3,
  D = 0.9) 
```

It is possible to run the function over multiple scenarios as well as enable the function to log the focal variable:

```{r}
rcme_ind(
  formula = "disorder ~ violent_crime + white_british + unemployment + median_age",
  data = crime_disorder,
  focal_variable = "violent_crime",
  R = c(0.3, 0.6, 0.9),
  D = c(0.9, 0.95, 1, 1.05, 1.1),
  log_var = T) 

```

When measurement error is on the outcome you can use the `rcme_out()` function:

```{r}
rcme_out_ex <- rcme_out(
  formula = "damage_crime ~ collective_efficacy + unemployment + white_british + median_age",
  data = crime_damage,
  focal_variable = "collective_efficacy",
  R = c(0.25, 0.35, 0.45),
  D = c(0.9, 0.95, 1, 1.05, 1.10),
  log_var = F)

```

You can also visualize the results of the simulations easily using `rcme_sim_plot()`:

```{r}
rcme_sim_plot(rcme_out_ex, ci = T, naive = T)
```

The result of this function is just a normal `ggplot2` object which can be changed and saved accordingly:

```{r}
rcme_sim_plot(rcme_out_ex, ci = T, naive = T) +
  ggplot2::theme_dark()
```
